**As regulations shift and commercial interests move in, a governance gap emerges: existing frameworks struggle to distinguish between protected practices and prohibited activities, between sacred traditions and commercial extraction, between cultural preservation and market opportunity. This gap creates uncertainty, risk, and opportunity—often for the wrong actors.**

## The Gap

The governance gap exists where:

- **Regulatory frameworks are incomplete** - They don't adequately address the full range of entheogenic practices
- **Legal protections are fragmented** - Religious exercise, cultural preservation, and therapeutic use are treated differently
- **Commercial interests exploit uncertainty** - Gaps create profit opportunities
- **Traditional practices lack clear protection** - Communities struggle to navigate unclear legal terrain

## Three Dimensions of the Gap

### 1. Regulatory Incompleteness

Substance-centric regulation:
- Focuses on chemistry, not practices
- Overlooks non-substance methods
- Ignores context and intention
- Creates contradictions and anomalies

**Result:** Practices that should be similar are treated differently.

### 2. Protection Fragmentation

Legal protections exist but are fragmented:
- **Religious exercise** - Protected under First Amendment and RFRA, but narrowly applied
- **Cultural preservation** - Recognized for indigenous communities, but limited
- **Therapeutic use** - Legalized in some contexts, but restricted
- **Personal use** - Decriminalized in some jurisdictions, but still prohibited federally

**Result:** Similar practices receive different levels of protection.

### 3. Commercial Exploitation

Commercial interests exploit gaps:
- Regulatory uncertainty creates profit opportunities
- Market framing reduces practices to commodities
- Traditional knowledge gets extracted
- Communities get marginalized

**Result:** Money flows, but meaning and tradition risk being lost.

## Why This Matters

The governance gap matters because:

1. **It creates risk for practitioners** - Uncertainty about legal status creates fear and limits practice

2. **It enables exploitation** - Commercial interests exploit gaps at the expense of communities

3. **It fragments protection** - Similar practices receive different levels of legal protection

4. **It resists resolution** - No coherent framework addresses the full range of practices

## The Entheogenic Doctrine as Framework

The [Entheogenic Doctrine](/doctrine) provides a framework for understanding the gap:

- **Broad definition** - Encompasses all methods of consciousness alteration
- **Context recognition** - Acknowledges that context matters
- **Protection framework** - Frames practices within protected categories
- **Resistance to commodification** - Maintains focus on practices, not just markets

## What Fills the Gap

In the absence of coherent governance, various actors fill the gap:

- **Commercial interests** - Frame practices as markets, extract value
- **Legal practitioners** - Navigate uncertainty, seek protections
- **Community organizers** - Build frameworks, preserve traditions
- **Regulators** - Create rules, often reactively
- **Scholars** - Analyze patterns, propose frameworks

This archive documents how the gap is filled—and by whom.

## The Future

The governance gap will likely:

- **Persist** - As long as regulation remains substance-centric
- **Evolve** - As new cases and regulations emerge
- **Intensify** - As commercial interests increase
- **Require resolution** - Eventually, frameworks must become more coherent

This archive tracks that evolution.
